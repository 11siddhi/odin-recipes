        <p>Indulge in delicious homemade doughnuts anytime with this easy-to-follow recipe. You'll find the full recipe below with step-by-step instructions, but here's what you can expect when you make this top-rated recipe: </p>
        <p>Start by sprinkling yeast over warm water to activate, then add flour, sugar, salt, milk, shortening, and eggs to create the dough. Knead the dough until smooth, cover it, and allow it to rise until doubled in size. </p>
        <p>Roll the dough out to a Â½ inch thickness before using a doughnut cutter to create a shape. Let the doughnuts rise a second time before deep-frying and glazing. </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 envelopes active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1/4 cup warm water (105 to 115 degrees)</li>
            <li>1/2 cups lukewarm milk</li>
            <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>1/3 cup shortening</li>
            <li>5 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 quart vegetable oil for frying</li>
            <li>1/3 cup butter</li>
            <li>2 cups confectioners' sugar</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla</li>
            <li>4 tablespoon hot water or as needed</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water, and let stand for 5 minutes, or until foamy. </li>
            <li>In a large bowl, mix together the yeast mixture, milk, sugar, salt, eggs, shortening, and 2 cups of the flour. Mix for a few minutes at low speed, or stirring with a wooden spoon. Beat in remaining flour 1/2 cup at a time, until the dough no longer sticks to the bowl. Knead for about 5 minutes, or until smooth and elastic. Place the dough into a greased bowl, and cover. Set in a warm place to rise until double. Dough is ready if you touch it, and the indention remains. </li>
            <li>Turn the dough out onto a floured surface, and gently roll out to 1/2 inch thickness. Cut with a floured doughnut cutter. Let doughnuts sit out to rise again until double. Cover loosely with a cloth. </li>
            <li>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in confectioners' sugar and vanilla until smooth. Remove from heat, and stir in hot water one tablespoon at a time until the icing is somewhat thin, but not watery. Set aside. </li>
            <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large heavy skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Slide doughnuts into the hot oil using a wide spatula. Turn doughnuts over as they rise to the surface. Fry doughnuts on each side until golden brown. Remove from hot oil, to drain on a wire rack. Dip doughnuts into the glaze while still hot, and set onto wire racks to drain off excess. Keep a cookie sheet or tray under racks for easier clean up. </li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
